     <strong>Cubos</strong> is a voxel based game engine written in C++ and using OpenGL, with an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. I've been working on it since Dec 2022.
     <br/>Here's a video of our game that won Coffee'n Jam 2024.

        <li>Delta Time Resource.</li>
        <li>Minor graphical features.</li>
        <li>Collision Plugin: Components, Narrow Phase, SAT, Collision Manifold, Contact Caching, Collision Layers.</li>
        <li>Physics Plugin: Components, Integration, Solver (XPBD solver and later TGS soft impulse solver), Penetration Constraint, Warm-Starting, Physics Materials.</li>
        <li>Managing Collisions and Physics Plugins:  designed the plugins, with focus on performance, planned work (opened issues), assigned priorities and tasks to members of the team.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="paragraph">
        I initially started working on the engine's demos, then moved to some smaller engine tasks and it was only when I started working on the narrow phase collision detection that I started to take it seriously. I had always had interest in physics, and so when the oportunity came I started the physics plugin (each funcionality of the engine is divided into plugins), and at this point I was well inside the rabit hole.<br/>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Since then, a lot of research on physics and efficient C++, was done. I've implemented two different collision solvers, initially XPBD and currently an impulse solver. Currently, we have working collisions for box shapes and voxel shapes, full rigid body simulation for these shapes, collision layers and different physics materials, beyond other stability functionalities that the users don't even need to know about.<br/>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Recently, with the expansion of the project, and restructuring into teams, I've been guiding the development of the physics and collisions for the engine. Currently, the team is composed of three members, for whom I manage and review the work. I also represent the team in general meetings, with the lead of the project, and I'm the contact point for any issues regarding these areas of the engine.

        This game was the first time I attempted to create an infinite level, and had to do the entire design of each section so that they fit each other and didn't feel very repetitive. 
        I also challenged myself to implement the enemies instead of the player character.
        Additionally, I tried to make the experience a bit more cinematic and smooth, which includes the black silhouette shader when the player is about to die, the starting menu which presents the setting while allowing the player to learn the movement before starting, as well as the oxygen indicator that moves with the player, akin to how the information is presented to the player in Dead Space for example.
        Overall, I learned many new interesting techniques, and worked efficiently with a great team to produce this game.

        This project was a great way to learn about the overall development process of a game. The feedback we got from professionals who tested our prototype was also very educational, and brought attention to important details I had never though of before, such as attack combos and timings. Additionally, our team worked alongside an audio student from another school, who produced the sounds for the game, and two writers from another school as well. It was very challenging, given we had just 2 months, but it was very fullfilling, and we were proud of how it turned out.
